                  After working as an educator for 8 years in impoverished,
                  urban communities, I have a newfound respect for
                  the classroom teacher. Along with curriculum, they teach
                  social skills, emotional wellness and so much more. Because of this, many 
                  educators are simply overwhelmed.  As a web developer, I endeavor to shape digital
                  products to make the art of teaching meaningful, engaging and streamlined.
